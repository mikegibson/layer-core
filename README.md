Sentient CMF
============

What is it?
-----------
Sentient is a full-stack web framework with content management features. It is built on the [Silex microframework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) and many components from [Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/). It uses [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) for its ORM and DBAL, and [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for its templating engine.

It's not quite ready for production use yet.

Installation
------------
The easiest way to install Sentient is with the [Skeleton App](https://github.com/mikegibson/sentient-app).
